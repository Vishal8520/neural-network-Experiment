Propmpt:
Write a Python program that creates a perceptron to learn the AND gate using numpy and matplotlib. Start by setting all weights and bias to zero. While the program is training, show a table for each round that displays the inputs, what output we want, what output we got, the error, and the current weights. Draw a graph that shows a line separating the data points, and update this graph after every training round. Mark the correct predictions and wrong predictions with different colors or shapes so we can tell them apart. Add a 2-second wait time between each training round so we can watch how the learning happens step by step. After the training is complete and the perceptron has learned correctly, show a final graph that displays how the error changed over time during training. Also include a simple explanation in plain words about how the perceptron learns and makes its decisions.
